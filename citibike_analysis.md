### Popular location
NYC data shows that if bike stop (pickup/return) is at popular location then people are tend to use more bikes. Des Moines also has many popular tourist destination and having bike stop (pickup/return) will increase the chances of number poeple riding the bike. https://www.catchdesmoines.com/things-to-do/ there are many populat tourist destnations example Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden, Blank Park Zoo, Outdoor Trails ect.

### Peak Hours
NYC data shows that around 5-7pm are peak bike riding hours. If more bikes combine with popular location during this peak hours will help people to prefer bike to save commute time.
